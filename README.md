# Linked List Visualizer (Terminal-Based with Memory Representation)

This is a **terminal-based linked list visualizer** built with Python.  
It simulates how linked lists work under the hood by displaying:
- Each node's **memory address**
- The node's **value**
- The memory address of its **next node**

###  Example Output:
[0x100f5a10] â€˜appleâ€™ â†’ [0x100f5a30] â€˜bananaâ€™ â†’ [0x100f5a50] â€˜cherryâ€™ â†’ None

## ðŸ›  Features (Planned)
- Insert at end
- Delete a node
- Show memory addresses (`id()` of nodes)
- Visualize linked list after each operation

##  Status
**In Progress** â€” core functionality is being implemented.

##  Goals
- Help learners visualize the structure of a linked list
- Show how nodes are connected via memory addresses
- Make data structures more tangible and fun
